# Simple Student Registration System

This Python program provides a basic command-line interface for managing student records. You can easily add, update, view, and remove student information.

## Features

* **Add Students:** Input student details like ID, name, address, contact information, and courses.
* **Update Students:** Modify existing student records by entering their ID.
* **View Students:** Retrieve and display student information by ID.
* **Remove Students:** Delete student records from the system.
* **Simple Menu:** Navigate through the program using a numbered menu.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```
2.  **Run the Python script:**
    ```bash
    python [your_script_name.py]
    ```
3.  **Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the system.**

## Usage

The program presents a numbered menu with the following options:

1.  Add student
2.  Update student
3.  Show student
4.  Remove student
5.  Exit

Enter the corresponding number to perform the desired action.

## Limitations

* Data is stored in memory and is not persistent across program executions.
* Basic input validation is minimal.
* The system is designed for simple student management and lacks advanced features.

## Future Enhancements

* Implement data persistence using files (CSV, JSON) or a database (SQLite).
* Add more robust input validation and error handling.
* Implement search functionality by name or other criteria.
* Implement a GUI.
* Refactor code to use classes.
